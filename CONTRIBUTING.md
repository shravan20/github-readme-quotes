## Layout Contribution

GitHub Readme Quotes would appreciate your contribution to new layouts!

All you need to do is edit [layouts/layout.js](./src/layouts/layout.js) file and add your layout at the end of the file.

Please consider the following steps if you are planning to contribute a new layout:

1. Provide a screenshot of your layout in your Pull Request.
2. The layout has mainly two parts: 
    - Style(CSS of the layout)
    - Structure(HTML of the layout)
3. Make sure you add your layout in this format:
<pre>
    layout_name:{
        style:()=>{
            `CSS of the Layout`
        }
        structure:()=>{
            `HTML of the Layout`
        }
    }
</pre>
